Our Galaxy is a disk, so large that it takes light about 100,000 years to travel from one end to the other. As vast as the Milky Way is, it is only one of something like a trillion galaxies in our observable Universe. Before astronomical telescopes, only a few nearby galaxies could be seen from Earth. But as soon as we could make detailed observations of other galaxies, astronomers noticed something strange: Distant galaxies are moving away from us. But if we can barely see these things, how do we know they are moving away? This has to do with redshifting.\n\n\nCredit: ESO/L.Calçada/spaceengine.org"

The two closest spirals went from being 1 cm apart to 10 cm apart, but the ends have gone from 5 cm to 50 in the same amount of time! They started further apart, so they moved apart faster.\nBecause of the relation between how distant a galaxy is and how fast it is receding from us, we use redshift to talk about distances. But because light takes time to travel to us from distant galaxies, we also use redshift as a way to talk about time. A galaxy with a high redshift is not only far away from us in space, it’s also far away in time: its light has taken billions of years to reach us. Cosmology gives us this opportunity to see the history of our Universe directly. We see stars as they were tens or hundreds of years ago, and other galaxies as they were millions or billions of years ago.

    "text": "The basic idea of the Big Bang theory is simple: if the Universe is expanding now, it must have been smaller in the past. If we reverse this expansion, we find that everything we see today, matter and radiation, must have been compressed to an unimaginable degree. At some point in the past, the Universe was so dense that it couldn’t contain the kind of matter we see today: everything was an ultradense, hot plasma. You can think of the early Universe as an inside-out star. The core of the star is so hot that nuclear reactions are happening everywhere in the plasma, forming the first atomic nuclei in a process called nucleosynthesis. Photons are constantly bouncing off protons and electrons, and cannot travel very far. But the Universe keeps expanding; as time passes, it’s like we’re moving from the core of the star to its diffuse edge. Eventually, after about 380,000 years, the plasma has become cool enough for the first atoms to form, in a process called recombination. Now, the photons are able to travel freely, like the light of the star shining out into space. This afterglow is called the cosmic microwave background and comes to us from everywhere in the sky. It’s not emitted by stars and galaxies, it really comes from the primordial plasma, showing us the Universe as it was 13.8 billion years ago. From our perspective, these photons seem to come from a spherical region that we call the surface of last-scattering. This is the most distant surface of light that we can see, since beyond that the Universe is opaque. After recombination, apart from the CMB, the Universe remained dark for a while (200 million years) because there were no stars yet. The cosmos was a sea of hydrogen and helium atoms, but matter was not distributed uniformly. Through gravity, denser regions attracted more matter, and became hotter – hot enough to eventually trigger nuclear fusion and form the first stars. Through more gravitational instability, more structures of the Universe formed, like the galaxies and clusters of galaxies that we see today, while the Universe kept expanding. A few billion years ago, the expansion of the Universe started to accelerate, driven by a mysterious component that we call dark energy. It’s likely the Universe will continue to expand forever.\n\n\nCredit: NASA (https://science.nasa.gov/universe/overview/)."

    "text": "A witness of the homogeneous early universe\n\nLet’s come back to the CMB. There is another clue why the light really is from the primordial plasma. It has to do with its spectrum, which is the intensity of light at different wavelengths. In the 1990s, the COBE satellite found that the CMB has a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum, which is what you expect from anything that glows with heat. The fact that the CMB has this spectrum is a strong confirmation of the Big Bang theory. The peak of the spectrum is determined by the temperature. The temperature of the CMB when it was emitted was about 3000 K, but because of the expansion the light has been redshifted and it is now only 2.7K, in the microwave range, hence the name. This temperature is remarkably uniform across the sky.\n\n\nThe blackbody spectrum of the CMB (Fixsen 1996 adapted by D. Baumann)"

C’est la première fois qu’une telle solution est démontrée de manière numériquement “gérable”.\nLa combinaison du nouveau pair-differencing et du gap filling ouvre la voie à un map-making polarisé robuste statistiquement, efficace numériquement et réaliste pour les SATs au sol — avec des applications imminentes."
