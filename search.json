    "text": "Let’s start here, on Earth. Our planet is part of the Solar System, and orbits the Sun. The Sun is one of approximately 400 billion stars in our Galaxy, the Milky Way.\nOur Galaxy is a disk so large that it takes light about 100,000 years to travel from one end to the other. As vast as the Milky Way is, it is only one of a trillion galaxies in our observable Universe.\nBefore astronomical telescopes, only a few nearby galaxies could be seen from Earth. But as soon as we could make detailed observations of other galaxies, astronomers noticed something strange: Distant galaxies are moving away from us.\n\n\nCredit: ESO/L.Calçada/spaceengine.org"

The farther away the galaxy, the faster it recedes from us.\nPlot distance vs redshift = Hubble diagram (modern version on figure). Used to measure expansion rate of the Universe.\nExpected if all galaxies are moving away from each other = U expanding in every direction.\nHere is how that kind of uniform expansion works. Say you have a spring and stretch it out. The two closest spirals went from being 1 mm apart to 1 cm apart, but the ends have gone from 1 cm to 50 in the same amount of time! They started further apart, so they moved apart faster.\nBecause of the relation between how distant a galaxy is and how fast it is receding from us, we use redshift to talk about distances. But because light takes time to travel to us from distant galaxies, we also use redshift as a way to talk about time. A galaxy with a high redshift is not only far away from us in space, it’s also far away in time: its light has taken billions of years to reach us.\nCosmology gives us an opportunity to see the history of our Universe directly. We see stars as they were tens or hundreds of years ago, and other galaxies as they were millions or billions of years ago. Can we look so far away and into the past that we see the Big Bang itself? The answer is yes.\n\n\n\n\nRedshift = wavelength of light stretched as galaxy moves away\nDistance-redshift relation: farther away = faster away\nThe Universe is expanding in every direction!\nFinite speed of light: look back in time\n\nHigh redshift = far away in space and in time.\n\n\n\n\nModern Hubble diagram using supernovae [Riess et al 2016]"

    "text": "Hot Big Bang = Universe was smaller in the past.\nReverse the expansion: everything was compressed into a very small space. Universe so dense, ordinary matter could not exist. Ultra-dense hot plasma of elementary particles.\nNow the expansion starts. Formal description = standard cosmological model (based on GR).\nNuclear reactions happening everywhere, forming the first atomic nuclei -&gt; nucleosynthesis. Photons constantly bouncing off protons and electrons, cannot travel very far.\nUniverse keeps expanding. Eventually, after about 380,000 years, the plasma has become cool enough for the first atoms to form, in a process called recombination. The Universe becomes transparent, and the photons are able to travel freely, carrying with them a snapshot of the primordial Universe.\nThis afterglow of the Big Bang is called the cosmic microwave background (CMB). From our perspective, these photons seem to come from a spherical region that we call the surface of last-scattering. This is the most distant surface of light that we can see, since beyond that the Universe is opaque.\nAfter recombination, apart from the CMB, the Universe remained dark for a while (200 million years) because there were no stars yet. However, the matter was not distributed uniformly.\nWhile the Universe kept expanding, denser regions attracted more matter, and became hotter. Hot enough to eventually trigger nuclear fusion and form the first stars, and then galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and so on.\nA few billion years ago, the expansion of the Universe started to accelerate, driven by a mysterious component that we call dark energy. It is still accelerating today.\n\n\nCredit: NASA (https://science.nasa.gov/universe/overview/)."

    "text": "A witness of the homogeneous early universe\n\nLet’s come back to the CMB.\nThere is another clue why the light really is from the primordial plasma. It has to do with its spectrum, which is the intensity of light at different wavelengths.\nIn the 1990s, the COBE satellite found that the CMB has a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum, which is what you expect from anything that glows with heat. The fact that the CMB has this spectrum is a strong confirmation of the Big Bang theory.\nThe peak of the spectrum is determined by the temperature. The temperature of the CMB when it was emitted was about 3000 K, but because of the expansion the light has been redshifted and it is now only 2.7K, in the microwave range, hence the name.\nThis temperature is remarkably uniform across the sky.\n\n\nThe blackbody spectrum of the CMB (Fixsen 1996 adapted by D.
