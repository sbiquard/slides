# Introduction {background-color=#40666e}

# An expanding universe

::: {.notes}
The one fundamental fact I want to you to remember is that we live in an **expanding** universe.
The goal of this introduction is to explain how we know that, and what it means for us.

::: {.notes}
Let's start here, on Earth.
Our planet is part of the Solar System, and orbits the Sun.
The Sun is one of approximately 400 billion stars in our Galaxy, the Milky Way.

Our Galaxy is a disk so large that it takes light about 100,000 years to travel from one end to the other.
As vast as the Milky Way is, it is only one of a trillion galaxies in our observable Universe.

Before astronomical telescopes, only a few nearby galaxies could be seen from Earth.
But as soon as we could make detailed observations of other galaxies, astronomers noticed something strange:
Distant galaxies are moving **away** from us.

We can measure that through an effect called *redshifting*.

## Redshifting

::: {.notes}
Like the Doppler effect for sound, which causes the pitch of a siren to drop as it moves away from us, the wavelength of light is stretched as its source moves away.

Since the longest visible wavelength is red, light from a receding source appears reddened, or in technical terms, redshifted.

The redshift parameter z is defined as the fractional change in wavelength between emission and reception.
The faster a star or galaxy is receding, the more its light is redshifted.
:::

- Doppler effect for sound
  - pitch of a siren drops as it moves away
- Same for light:
  - wavelength is stretched as source moves away
  <!--- longest visible wavelength = red-->
  - **redshift** $z \equiv (\lambda_0 - \lambda_1) / \lambda_1$
  - fractional change in wavelength between emission and reception

## Hubble's law

::: {.notes}
1920s: astronomers measured the redshifts of several distant galaxies.
The farther away the galaxy, the faster it recedes from us.
This kind of distance-redshift relation is still in use today to measure the rate of expansion of the Universe.

Center of some repulsion field?
In fact, expected if *all* galaxies are moving away from each other.
Which is exactly what happens if U is expanding the same way in every direction.

## Expansion

::: {.notes}
Here is how that kind of uniform expansion works.
Say you have a spring and stretch it out.
The two closest spirals went from being 1 mm apart to 1 cm apart, but the ends have gone from 1 cm to 50 in the same amount of time!
They started further apart, so they moved apart faster.

Because of the relation between how distant a galaxy is and how fast it is receding from us, we use redshift to talk about distances.
But because light takes time to travel to us from distant galaxies, we also use redshift as a way to talk about time.
A galaxy with a high redshift is not only far away from us in space, it's also far away in time: its light has taken billions of years to reach us.

Cosmology gives us an opportunity to see the history of our Universe directly.
We see stars as they were tens or hundreds of years ago, and other galaxies as they were millions or billions of years ago.
Can we look so far away and into the past that we see the Big Bang itself? The answer is yes.
:::

- The Universe is **expanding** in every direction!
- Distance-redshift relation
  - use redshift to talk about *distances*
- Finite speed of light
  - use redshift to talk about *time*

High redshift = far away in **space** and in **time**.

::: {.notes}
The Hot Big Bang theory is the idea that, since the Universe is expanding now, it must have been smaller in the past.
If we reverse this expansion, we find that everything we see today, matter and radiation, must have been compressed to an unimaginable degree.
At some point in the past, the Universe was so dense that it couldn't contain the kind of matter we see today: everything was an ultradense, hot plasma.

You can think of the early Universe as an inside-out star.
The core of the star is so hot that nuclear reactions are happening everywhere in the plasma, forming the first atomic nuclei in a process called nucleosynthesis.
Photons are constantly bouncing off protons and electrons, and cannot travel very far.

But the Universe keeps expanding; as time passes, it's like we're moving from the core of the star to its diffuse edge.
Eventually, after about 380,000 years, the plasma has become cool enough for the first atoms to form, in a process called recombination.
Now, the photons are able to travel freely, like the light of the star shining out into space.

This afterglow of the Big Bang is called the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and comes to us from everywhere in the sky.
It's not emitted by stars and galaxies, it really comes from the primordial plasma, showing us the Universe as it was 13.8 billion years ago.
From our perspective, these photons seem to come from a spherical region that we call the surface of last-scattering.
This is the most distant surface of light that we can see, since beyond that the Universe is opaque.

After recombination, apart from the CMB, the Universe remained dark for a while (200 million years) because there were no stars yet.
The cosmos was a sea of hydrogen and helium atoms, but matter was not distributed uniformly.
Through gravity, denser regions attracted more matter, and became hotter -- hot enough to eventually trigger nuclear fusion and form the first stars.
Through more gravitational instability, more structures of the Universe formed, like the galaxies and clusters of galaxies that we see today, while the Universe kept expanding.

A few billion years ago, the expansion of the Universe started to accelerate, driven by a mysterious component that we call dark energy.
It's likely the Universe will continue to expand forever.

## A witness of the homogeneous early universe

::: {.notes}
Let's come back to the CMB.

There is another clue why the light really is from the primordial plasma.
It has to do with its spectrum, which is the intensity of light at different wavelengths.

In the 1990s, the COBE satellite found that the CMB has a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum, which is what you expect from anything that glows with heat.
The fact that the CMB has this spectrum is a strong confirmation of the Big Bang theory.

The peak of the spectrum is determined by the temperature.
The temperature of the CMB when it was emitted was about 3000 K, but because of the expansion the light has been redshifted and it is now only 2.7K, in the microwave range, hence the name.

This temperature is remarkably uniform across the sky.
:::

## The Horizon Problem

::: {.notes}
But the fact that the CMB has the same temperature everywhere we look is paradoxical.

The light from 2 opposite points on the LSS "meets" for the first time right now when reaching us.
For them to be the same temperature, they must have been in causal contact in the past, but there simply hasn't been enough time for that.

This is called the horizon problem.
:::

- Why is the CMB so homogeneous?
- Points at same temperature must have been in contact

# Cosmic inflation

::: {.notes}
In some way, the presence of the CMB is both a triumph of the Hot Big Bang theory,
and a sign that cosmic history must be more complex than the picture I described before.

In the 1980s, theorists proposed an addition to the standard Big Bang model that solves the horizon problem.
It is called cosmic inflation.
:::

## A solution: cosmic inflation

::: {.notes}
Inflation is the idea that, in the very first fractions of a second after the Big Bang, the Universe went through a phase of extremely rapid expansion.

As illustrated in the figure, inflation is a bit like enlarging a single pixel of an image.

This expansion was fast enough to take a causally connected region of space and blow it up to a size bigger than our observable Universe.

## Successes of inflation

::: {.notes}
Technically, the simplest way to achieve inflation is through a scalar field $\phi$ evolving in a potential $V(\phi)$ that is not too steep.
Such a configuration leads to so-called 'slow-roll' inflation.

Remarkably, there is now a beam of observational evidence that agrees with the predictions of single-field slow-roll inflation.
(Gaussian and adiabatic perturbations, near scale-invariance, spatial flatness, etc.)

But the most impressive feature of inflation is that it provides a mechanism to generate the correct initial conditions for the Universe to evolve into what we see today.

This mechanism is quantum fluctuations of the scalar field $\delta\phi$ which cause different regions of space to inflate by slightly different amounts.
This leads to small inhomogeneities in the density of the Universe at the end of inflation, which later grow under the influence of gravity to form galaxies and other structures.

. . .

Quantum fluctuations $\delta\phi$ -> seeds of cosmic structure!

## Primordial gravitational waves

::: {.notes}
But as Carl Sagan put it, "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."

It turns out there is a very clean prediction of inflation models that could provide such evidence: primordial gravitational waves.
Fluctuations I have mentioned up to now are what we call *scalar* perturbations, whereas GWs are formally *tensor* perturbations.

The amplitude of tensor perturbations relative to scalar perturbations is quantified by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$.
It is directly related to the energy at which inflation took place.

The measurement of $r$ is therefore a direct window into the first instants of the Universe,
and an opportunity to learn about the laws of Physics at ultra-high energies, far beyond the reach of current particle accelerators on Earth.

Moreover, primordial GWs leave a unique imprint that we can look for in the CMB!
:::

Inflation also predicts **gravitational waves**.

- Scalar perturbations: $\Delta^2_s(k) = A_s (k/k_*)^{n_s - 1}$
- Tensor perturbations: $\Delta^2_t(k) = A_t (k/k_*)^{n_t}$
- Tensor-to-scalar ratio:
$$
r \equiv A_t / A_s \propto E^4_\mathrm{inf}
$$

- Window into physics at ultra-high energies
- GWs leave a unique imprint in the CMB

# The cosmic microwave background

::: {.notes}
To understand how to detect primordial GWs in the CMB, we need to understand a bit more about the CMB itself and how we observe it.
:::

## Discovery {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
The CMB was discovered by accident in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, working at Bell Labs in New Jersey.

They were experimenting with a very sensitive horn antenna (figure) to detect radio signals bounced off a satellite.
After reducing their data, they found a residual excess noise that they couldn't get rid of, whichever direction they pointed the antenna.

It was realised with the help of a nearby group at Princeton that this noise was perfectly consistent with predictions of uniform background of microwaves left over from the Big Bang.
Penzias and Wilson were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978.

## Temperature anisotropies {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
After its discovery, experiments were launched to measure the CMB in more detail.
In particular, to try and find small variations in temperature across the sky: *anisotropies*.

It is a good place to remember George Smoot, Nobel laureate in 2006 for his work on the CMB.
George was associated with APC for many years, and passed away a few days ago.

He made the first measurement of the dipole anisotropy of the CMB, interpreted as due to the motion of the Earth with respect to the CMB rest frame.
He was also principal investigator of the COBE satellite mission, which measured the blackbody spectrum of the CMB and discovered anisotropies in the 1990s.

If we follow the inflationary paradigm, we can relate these anisotropies to the initial density fluctuations.
In overdense regions, gravity tries to compress matter while radiation pressure pushes back, creating oscillations in the primordial plasma, like sound waves in air.

The temperature fluctuations we see are the direct consequence of these *acoustic oscillations*, and therefore probe the physics of the primordial plasma.

## Increasingly precise measurements

::: {.notes}
In the early 2000s, many experiments especially ground-based and balloon-borne improved the sensitivity and angular resolution of anisotropy measurements.
But during two decades, it was two satellite missions that fuelled much of the progress in CMB science: WMAP and _Planck_.

# CMB polarisation

::: {.notes}
Temperature anisotropies teach us a lot about the Universe.
But to understand inflation, we need to look at another property of the CMB: its polarisation.
:::

## Basics of polarisation {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
Light is polarised when its electric field oscillates preferentially in a given direction (example below).

The CMB is polarised through Thomson scattering of photons off free electrons in the primordial plasma.
The efficiency of this process depends on the angle between the incoming and outgoing polarisation directions.

To characterise linear polarisation, we use the Stokes parameters $I$, $Q$ and $U$.
:::

- Thomson scattering $\propto \lvert \hat\epsilon \cdot \hat\epsilon' \rvert^2$
- 3 **Stokes parameters** entirely describe linear polarisation

  - $U$ = difference in brightness between +45¬∞ and -45¬∞

:::
::::

## $E$ and $B$ modes

::: {.notes}
Polarisation field = polar direction + amplitude at each point on the sky.
The same way as temperature maps, we can make Q and U maps of the sky.

But Q and U depend on a choice of coordinate system, so they are not easy to interpret physically.
Instead, we decompose the field into two components called $E$ (parity-even) and $B$ (parity-odd) patterns.

$E$ and $B$ are directly related to the physical processes happening in the plasma.
Remarkably, $B$ modes are only sourced by **tensor** perturbations, GWs! (at first order)

By measuring CMB polarisation, specifically B modes, we have access to $r$ and inflation.

## Current constraints on $r$

::: {.notes}
For now, no detection of primordial $B$ modes has been made.
We only have upper limits on the value of $r$.

The best constraint to date is from the BICEP/Keck collaboration combined with *Planck*, $r < 0.032$ at 95% CL.

The figure on the right shows why this measurement is so difficult.
It shows, in log scale, the power spectrum of the different components contributing to the measurement.

To measure $r$ we target either the recombination bump at $\ell \sim 100$ (roughly one degree) or the reionisation bump at very large scales ($\ell < 10$).
In both cases we need a measurement of the CMB polarisation at intermediate to large scales.

## The Simons Observatory {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
Measuring $r$ is one of the main science goals of the Simons Observatory.

The observatory is located in the Atacama desert in Chile, which is high and dry, ideal for millimetre-wave observations.
SO builds on decades of experience in observing CMB from the ground.

It comprises three small aperture telescopes (SATs) dedicated to the measurement of large scale polarisation.
A large aperture telescope (LAT) will observe smaller scales (high resolution) over a large fraction of the sky.

Very broad science case, from inflation to neutrino mass and number of relativistic species, etc.
But the main goal for the SATs is to reach $\sigma(r) = 0.002$.

To meet these ambitious goals, SO has deployed about 60,000 detectors over 6 frequency bands.
Observations have started since last year, and we are analysing the data now!

# Reconstruction of CMB maps {background-color="#40666e"}

::: {.notes}
All this data collected by the telescopes needs to be processed and reduced to constraints of the cosmological parameters like $r$.

The size and complexity of the data increases with each generation of experiments, and so does the difficulty of the analysis.

In my thesis, I focused on a key step of this program, the reconstruction of CMB maps from the raw data.
:::

## From time-ordered data to maps

::: {.notes}
Because the CMB signal is faint, each individual data sample is noise dominated.

To achieve a good sensitivity across a significant sky area, CMB telescopes collect lost of measurements across the targeted area by **scanning**.
This also helps to mitigate low-frequency instrumental noise.

The raw data is therefore made of *time series* (one/detector) called time-ordered data (TOD).

With knowledge of the scanning strategy (pointing information) we can reconstruct the observed sky maps -> **map-making**.

It is the first step of several data reduction stages.
Huge compression of the data, therefore crucial step to avoid losing information.

Accurate modelling of noise and systematics required.

We **model** $P$ (pointing) and $T$ (templates).

We **assume** $n$ (noise) has covariance $N$.
:::
::::

"Map-making" = linear operation $\hat s = L d$ to estimate sky maps from the data.

## Unbiased estimators

Generic form of linear unbiased estimators [[Poletti et al. 2017]](http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201629467)
$$
\hat s = (P^\top F_T^{-1} P)^{-1} P^\top F_T^{-1} d
$$

with the filtering and weighing operator
$$
F_T = W \left[\mathbb I - T (T^\top W T)^{-1} T^\top W \right]
$$

- filters out unwanted signals (columns of $T$)
- weights orthogonal modes by weight matrix $W$

Minimum variance (optimal) if $W = N^{-1}$ (generalized least squares, GLS).

## Practical considerations {.smaller}

- Size of the problem
  - 10,000 detectors + months of data + sampling @100 Hz -> $n_t \sim 10^{12}$ samples!
  - resolution + sky coverage + Stokes (I)QU -> $n_p \sim 10^5 - 10^8$ sky pixels
  - **Numerical efficiency** is key!

. . .

- Noise correlations $N$ (size $n_t \times n_t$)
  - split data in chunks (trade-off efficiency/quality)
  - assume noise is stationary in each chunk, $N(t,t')=N(\lvert t-t' \rvert)$
  - characterise in Fourier space (power spectral density, PSD)

. . .

- **Iterative solvers**
  - can not compute/store matrices too large
  - $\hat s = A^{-1} b$ -> instead solve $A s = b$
  - conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm
  - convergence speed influenced by noise correlations

## Unbiased polarisation map-making

::: {.notes}
Total intensity $I$ hard to recover from the ground because of atmosphere.

Focus on polarisation instead; temperature large scales already very well measured from space (*Planck*).

Compare DW and PD and see how they manage to take advantage of hardware solutions.
:::

Focus on **unbiased reconstruction** (no filtering) of polarisation ($Q$ and $U$).

- **Minimal model**
  - no specific temporal or spatial structure
  - unpolarised atmosphere identical for orthogonal detectors
- **Down-weighting** (DW)
  - $W = (N_\mathrm{atm} + N_\mathrm{instr})^{-1}$
  - stationary noise, independent between detectors
- **Ideal reconstruction**
  - atmosphere-free data: $d = P s + n$ (instr. noise only)
  - GLS solution with $W = N_\mathrm{instr}^{-1}$
  - statistical benchmark

## Pair differencing

::: {.notes}
Pair diff (PD) is a widely used technique to extract polarisation information.
Half of the data is discarded, so it must be suboptimal?

No: show analytically that PD is **optimal** if no assumption on the atmosphere!
:::

Minimal model for pair of orthogonal detectors:
$$
d = \begin{bmatrix} d_\parallel \\ d_\perp \end{bmatrix}
    = \begin{bmatrix} T \\ T \end{bmatrix} x
    + \begin{bmatrix} P_{QU} \\ -P_{QU} \end{bmatrix} s_{QU}
    + \begin{bmatrix} n_\parallel \\ n_\perp \end{bmatrix}
$$

GLS template filtering estimator gives
$$
\hat s_{QU} = (P_{QU}^\top N_-^{-1} P_{QU})^{-1} P_{QU}^\top N_-^{-1} d_-
$$
with $d_- \equiv d_\parallel - d_\perp$ and $N_-$ the covariance of $n_- \equiv n_\parallel - n_\perp$.

Minimal model equivalent to **pair-differencing** (PD).

## Questions

- How do DW and PD compare out of the box?
  - different models, different assumptions
  - **implicit** differencing in DW ($W_\parallel = W_\perp$)
  - DW requires very good noise/atmosphere model

. . .

- How far is PD from the ideal reconstruction?

. . .

- What is the impact of systematic effects?

To answer these questions, I performed advanced time-domain simulations of an SO-like small aperture telescope.

I used the `toast` simulation framework and adjusted it for the needs of the study.

In particular I implemented the interface between `toast` and our reconstruction library, `mappraiser` (see figure).

Massively parallel implementation of the unbiased map-making estimator presented earlier, which I developed further.

- SO-like small aperture telescope
  - 350 pairs of detectors
  - HWP (optional)
- Realistic atmosphere simulation using [TOAST 3](https://github.com/hpc4cmb/toast/tree/toast3) framework
- Instrumental $1/f$ noise: $S(f) = \mathrm{NET}^2 [1 + (f_\mathrm{knee}/f)^\alpha]$
<!--TODO: Figure showing 1/f noise ?-->
- Map-making code: [MAPPRAISER](https://github.com/b3dcmb/midapack) library

## Results: PD map sensitivity {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
White noise -> analytical estimate of the noise level.

PD ideal if identical noise properties.
Perturb the nominal noise model and see how much we lose.

White instrumental noise.

- Ideal if only $N_\parallel = N_\perp$ (same noise properties)
- How much degradation if $N_\parallel \neq N_\perp$?
- Vary NET value from detector to detector
- Excess variance depends on
$$
\varepsilon \equiv \frac{\sigma_\parallel^2 - \sigma_\perp^2}{\sigma_\parallel^2 + \sigma_\perp^2}
$$
- Suboptimal propagation of noise levels after differencing

## Results: impact on $r$

::: {.notes}
Remarkable that we only lose a few percent of sensitivity to $r$ given the very general assumption behind PD.

Realistic instrumental noise with detector-dependent parameters.

Compute noise power spectrum $N_\ell^{BB}$ from PD maps and Fisher forecast of $\sigma(r=0)$.

Measure increase of error bars with respect to ideal forecast.

## Conclusion

- Primordial $B$ modes = window on first instants of the Universe
- Possible imprint in the large-scale CMB polarisation -> SATs
- Map-making = crucial step to maximise scientific return
- Ground telescopes must mitigate atmospheric contamination using dual-polarisation detectors and HWP
- No atmospheric model leads to intuitive pair differencing
- Near-optimal sensitivity to $r$ even with uneven detector properties

. . .

- Future: going to University of Manchester to work on SO SAT data
- Build a robust analysis pipeline and measure (constrain) $r$
