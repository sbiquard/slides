# Introduction {background-color=#40666e}

# An expanding universe

::: {.notes}
The one fundamental fact I want to you to remember is that we live in an **expanding** universe.
The goal of this introduction is to explain how we know that, and what it means for us.

::: {.notes}
Let's start here, on Earth.
Our planet is part of the Solar System, and orbits the Sun.
The Sun is one of approximately 400 billion stars in our Galaxy, the Milky Way.

Our Galaxy is a disk so large that it takes light about 100,000 years to travel from one end to the other.
As vast as the Milky Way is, it is only one of a trillion galaxies in our observable Universe.

Before astronomical telescopes, only a few nearby galaxies could be seen from Earth.
But as soon as we could make detailed observations of other galaxies, astronomers noticed something strange:
Distant galaxies are moving **away** from us.

## Expansion

::: {.notes}
We can measure that through an effect called *redshifting*.

1920s: astronomers measure redshifts of several distant galaxies.
The farther away the galaxy, the faster it recedes from us.

Plot distance vs redshift = Hubble diagram (modern version on figure).
Used to measure expansion rate of the Universe.

Expected if *all* galaxies are moving away from each other = U expanding in every direction.

Here is how that kind of uniform expansion works.
Say you have a spring and stretch it out.
The two closest spirals went from being 1 mm apart to 1 cm apart, but the ends have gone from 1 cm to 50 in the same amount of time!
They started further apart, so they moved apart faster.

Because of the relation between how distant a galaxy is and how fast it is receding from us, we use redshift to talk about distances.
But because light takes time to travel to us from distant galaxies, we also use redshift as a way to talk about time.
A galaxy with a high redshift is not only far away from us in space, it's also far away in time: its light has taken billions of years to reach us.

Cosmology gives us an opportunity to see the history of our Universe directly.
We see stars as they were tens or hundreds of years ago, and other galaxies as they were millions or billions of years ago.
Can we look so far away and into the past that we see the Big Bang itself? The answer is yes.

::: {.notes}
Hot Big Bang = Universe was smaller in the past.

Reverse the expansion: everything was compressed into a very small space.
Universe so dense, ordinary matter could not exist.
Ultra-dense hot plasma of elementary particles.

Now the expansion starts.
Formal description = standard cosmological model (based on GR).

Nuclear reactions happening everywhere, forming the first atomic nuclei -> nucleosynthesis.
Photons constantly bouncing off protons and electrons, cannot travel very far.

Universe keeps expanding.
Eventually, after about 380,000 years, the plasma has become cool enough for the first atoms to form, in a process called recombination.
The Universe becomes transparent, and the photons are able to travel freely, carrying with them a snapshot of the primordial Universe.

This afterglow of the Big Bang is called the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
From our perspective, these photons seem to come from a spherical region that we call the surface of last-scattering.
This is the most distant surface of light that we can see, since beyond that the Universe is opaque.

After recombination, apart from the CMB, the Universe remained dark for a while (200 million years) because there were no stars yet.
However, the matter was not distributed uniformly.

While the Universe kept expanding, denser regions attracted more matter, and became hotter.
Hot enough to eventually trigger nuclear fusion and form the first stars, and then galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and so on.

A few billion years ago, the expansion of the Universe started to accelerate, driven by a mysterious component that we call dark energy.
It is still accelerating today.

## A witness of the homogeneous early universe

::: {.notes}
Let's come back to the CMB.

There is another clue why the light really is from the primordial plasma.
It has to do with its spectrum, which is the intensity of light at different wavelengths.

In the 1990s, the COBE satellite found that the CMB has a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum, which is what you expect from anything that glows with heat.
The fact that the CMB has this spectrum is a strong confirmation of the Big Bang theory.

The peak of the spectrum is determined by the temperature.
The temperature of the CMB when it was emitted was about 3000 K, but because of the expansion the light has been redshifted and it is now only 2.7K, in the microwave range, hence the name.

This temperature is remarkably uniform across the sky.
:::

## The Horizon Problem

::: {.notes}
But the fact that the CMB has the same temperature everywhere we look is paradoxical.

The light from 2 opposite points on the LSS "meets" for the first time right now when reaching us.
For them to be the same temperature, they must have been in causal contact in the past, but there simply hasn't been enough time for that.

This is called the horizon problem.
:::

- Why is the CMB so homogeneous?
- Points at same temperature must have been in causal contact

# Cosmic inflation

::: {.notes}
In some way, the presence of the CMB is both a triumph of the Hot Big Bang theory,
and a sign that cosmic history must be more complex than the picture I described before.

In the 1980s, theorists proposed an addition to the standard Big Bang model that solves the horizon problem.
It is called cosmic inflation.
:::

## A solution: cosmic inflation

::: {.notes}
Inflation = phase of accelerated expansion before the standard expansion history.

As illustrated in the figure, inflation is a bit like enlarging a single pixel of an image to fill the entire screen.

This expansion took a causally connected region of space and blew it up to a size bigger than our observable Universe.
:::

Take a causally connected region of space and blow it up to a size bigger than our observable Universe.

## Successes of inflation {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
Simplest way to achieve inflation = scalar field $\phi$ with potential energy $V(\phi)$ >> kinetic energy.
'Slow-roll' inflation.

Most impressive feature = mechanism to generate initial conditions for structure formation.
Quantum fluctuations $\delta\phi$ cause different regions of space to inflate by slightly different amounts.
Leads to inhomogeneities of density at the end of inflation, which later grow under the influence of gravity to form galaxies and other structures.

Beam of observational evidence agreeing with predictions of single-field slow-roll inflation.
:::

  - Slow-roll inflation: $\phi$ with potential energy $V(\phi) \gg$ kinetic energy.
- Quantum fluctuations $\delta\phi$ -> seeds of cosmic structure!
- Measurements agree with slow-roll predictions: adiabatic, nearly scale-invariant perturbations, etc.

## Primordial gravitational waves

::: {.notes}
But "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."

Very clean prediction of inflation: primordial gravitational waves.

Follow slide text.

Moreover, primordial GWs leave a unique imprint that we can look for in the CMB!
:::

- Quantum fluctuations -> perturbations of metric tensor (space-time)
- Amplitude of perturbations as a function of size
  - scalar: $\Delta^2_s(k) = A_s (k/k_*)^{n_s - 1}$
  - tensor: $\Delta^2_t(k) = A_t (k/k_*)^{n_t}$
- Tensor perturbations = **gravitational waves** (GWs)
- Tensor-to-scalar ratio:
$$
r \equiv A_t / A_s \propto E^4_\mathrm{inflation}
$$

- Insight into the fundamental laws of Physics at very high energies

GWs leave a unique imprint in the CMB!

# The cosmic microwave background

::: {.notes}
To understand how to detect primordial GWs in the CMB, we need to understand a bit more about the CMB itself and how we observe it.
:::

## Discovery {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
The CMB was discovered by accident in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, working at Bell Labs in New Jersey.

Experimenting with a very sensitive horn antenna (figure) for trans-atlantic communication (using balloons to echo signal).

Residual excess noise in all directions of the sky, perfectly consistent with predictions of uniform background of microwaves left over from the Big Bang.

Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978.

## Temperature anisotropies {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
Experiments to measure CMB in more detail, try to find *anisotropies*.

Comment on figure.
Remove average brightness -> find dipole (motion of Earth).
Remove dipole -> see anisotropies!

Inflationary paradigm: relate anisotropies to initial perturbations.
Overdense regions: gravity tries to compress, radiation pressure pushes back -> acoustic oscillations in the plasma.

At last-scattering, photons coming from different regions have slightly different energy -> anisotropies.

A major contributor to the first measurement of these anisotropies was George Smoot.
Associated with APC for a long time, passed away a few days ago.
:::

## Increasingly precise measurements

::: {.notes}
In the early 2000s, many experiments especially ground-based and balloon-borne improved the sensitivity and angular resolution of anisotropy measurements.
But during two decades, it was two satellite missions that fuelled much of the progress in CMB science: WMAP and _Planck_.

Comment on the figure.
Remarkable agreement between theory and power spectrum measurements.

## Angular power spectrum {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
CMB anisotropies are noise (acoustic oscillations) -> spectral properties.

Temporal frequency for sound -> angular (spatial frequency) for CMB maps.

Formally: spherical harmonic decomposition of the fluctuations.

Power spectrum = variance of fluctuations at each angular scale.
:::

- How to characterise "noise"? Look at its **spectral properties**.
- Spatial/angular frequency: multipole moment $\ell$ -- angular scale $\theta \sim 2\pi / \ell$
- **Power spectrum** $C_\ell$ = variance of fluctuations at scale $\ell$

# CMB polarisation

::: {.notes}
Temperature anisotropies teach us a lot about the Universe.
But to understand inflation, we need to look at another property of the CMB: its polarisation.
:::

## Basics of polarisation {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
Light is polarised when its electric field oscillates preferentially in a given direction (example below).

The CMB is polarised through Thomson scattering of photons off free electrons in the primordial plasma.
The efficiency of this process depends on the angle between the incoming and outgoing polarisation directions.

To characterise linear polarisation, we use the Stokes parameters $I$, $Q$ and $U$.

The same way as temperature maps, we can make Q and U maps of the sky.
:::

:::: {.columns7030}
::: {.column}
- Thomson scattering $\propto \lvert \hat\epsilon \cdot \hat\epsilon' \rvert^2$
- 3 **Stokes parameters** entirely describe linear polarisation
  - $I$ = total intensity (temperature)
  - $Q$ = difference in brightness between horizontal and vertical
  - $U$ = difference in brightness between +45Â° and -45Â°

## $E$ and $B$ modes

Polarisation field = headless vector.

Q and U depend on coordinate system.
Decomposition into $E$ (parity-even) and $B$ (parity-odd) patterns.

$E$ and $B$ related to physical processes in the plasma.

Remarkably, $B$ modes are only sourced by **tensor** perturbations, GWs! (at first order)

By measuring CMB polarisation, specifically B modes, we have access to $r$ and inflation.

## Current constraints on $r$

::: {.notes}
For now, no detection of primordial $B$ modes has been made.
We only have upper limits on the value of $r$.

The best constraint to date is from the BICEP/Keck collaboration combined with *Planck* data.

The figure on the right shows measurements of $B$-mode power spectrum from various experiments.

Target either recombination bump ($\ell \approx 100$) or reionisation bump ($\ell \lt 10$).

In both cases we need a measurement of the CMB polarisation at intermediate to large scales.

## The Simons Observatory {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
Measuring $r$ is one of the main science goals of the Simons Observatory.

The observatory is located in the Atacama desert in Chile, which is high and dry, ideal for millimetre-wave observations.
SO builds on decades of experience in observing CMB from the ground.

It comprises three small aperture telescopes (SATs) dedicated to the measurement of large scale polarisation.
A large aperture telescope (LAT) will observe smaller scales (high resolution) over a large fraction of the sky.

Very broad science case, from inflation to neutrino mass and number of relativistic species, etc.
But the main goal for the SATs is to reach $\sigma(r) = 0.002$.

To meet these ambitious goals, SO has deployed about 60,000 detectors over 6 frequency bands.
Observations have started since last year, and we are analysing the data now!

# Reconstruction of CMB maps {background-color="#40666e"}

::: {.notes}
All this data collected by the telescopes needs to be processed and reduced to constraints of the cosmological parameters like $r$.

The size and complexity of the data increases with each generation of experiments, and so does the difficulty of the analysis.

In my thesis, I focused on a key step of this program, the reconstruction of CMB maps from the raw data.
:::

## From time-ordered data to maps

::: {.notes}
Start from figure on the right!

Lensing converts $E$ -> $B$ and vice versa.

CMB signal is faint: each individual data sample is noise dominated.

To achieve a good sensitivity across a significant sky area, CMB telescopes collect lost of measurements across the targeted area by **scanning**.
This also helps to mitigate low-frequency instrumental noise.

The raw data is therefore made of *time series* (one/detector) called time-ordered data (TOD).

With knowledge of the scanning strategy (pointing information) we can reconstruct the observed sky maps -> **map-making**.

It is the first step of several data reduction stages.
Huge compression of the data, therefore crucial step to avoid losing information.

Accurate modelling of noise and systematics required.

## Linear data model

::: {.notes}
Formally: linear data model.

What we recover/know/assume.

Map-making = linear operation.
:::

$$
d = Ps + Tx + n
$$

- we *know* $d$ (the data)
- we *estimate* $s$ (sky maps) and *marginalize* over $x$ (spurious signals)
- we *model* $P$ (pointing) and $T$ (templates)
- we *assume* that $n$ (noise) has covariance $N$

"Map-making" = linear operation $\hat s = L d$ to estimate sky maps from the data.

## Unbiased estimators

::: {.notes}
Weighted co-addition of the data with spurious signals filtered out.
:::

Generic linear unbiased estimator [[Poletti et al. 2017]](http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201629467)
$$
\hat s = (P^\top F_T P)^{-1} P^\top F_T d
$$

with filtering and weighting operator
$$
F_T = W \left[\mathbb I - T (T^\top W T)^{-1} T^\top W \right]
$$

- filters out unwanted signals (columns of $T$)
- weights orthogonal modes by weight matrix $W$

Minimum variance (optimal) if $W = N^{-1}$ (generalized least squares, GLS).

## Practical considerations {.smaller}

- Size of the problem
  - 1,000 detectors + months of data + sampling @100 Hz -> $n_t \sim 10^{11}$ samples!
  - resolution + sky coverage + Stokes (I)QU -> $n_p \sim 10^5 - 10^8$ sky pixels
  - **Numerical efficiency** is key!

. . .

- Noise correlations $N$ (size $n_t \times n_t$)
  - split data in chunks (trade-off efficiency/quality)
  - assume noise is stationary in each chunk, $N(t,t')=N(\lvert t-t' \rvert)$
  - characterise in Fourier space (power spectral density, PSD)

. . .

- **Iterative solvers**
  - can not compute/store matrices too large
  - $\hat s = A^{-1} b$ -> instead solve $A s = b$
  - preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm
  - convergence speed influenced by noise correlations

## Unbiased polarisation map-making

::: {.notes}
Total intensity $I$ hard to recover from the ground because of atmosphere.

Focus on polarisation instead; temperature large scales already very well measured from space (*Planck*).

Compare DW and PD and see how they manage to take advantage of hardware solutions.
:::

Focus on **unbiased reconstruction** of polarisation ($Q$ and $U$).

- **Minimal model**
  - no specific temporal or spatial structure
  - unpolarised atmosphere identical for orthogonal detectors
- **Down-weighting** (DW)
  - $W = (N_\mathrm{atm} + N_\mathrm{instr})^{-1}$
  - stationary noise, independent between detectors
- **Ideal reconstruction**
  - atmosphere-free data: $d = P s + n$ (instr. noise only)
  - GLS solution with $W = N_\mathrm{instr}^{-1}$
  - benchmark tool

## Pair differencing

::: {.notes}
Write down minimal model for one pair of detectors.

Use template filtering to estimate $Q$ and $U$, marginalising over $x$.

Find pair differencing!
:::

Minimal model for pair of orthogonal detectors:
$$
d = \begin{bmatrix} d_\parallel \\ d_\perp \end{bmatrix}
    = \begin{bmatrix} T \\ T \end{bmatrix} x
    + \begin{bmatrix} P_{QU} \\ -P_{QU} \end{bmatrix} s_{QU}
    + \begin{bmatrix} n_\parallel \\ n_\perp \end{bmatrix}
$$

GLS template filtering estimator gives
$$
\hat s_{QU} = (P_{QU}^\top N_-^{-1} P_{QU})^{-1} P_{QU}^\top N_-^{-1} d_-
$$
with $d_- \equiv d_\parallel - d_\perp$ and $N_-$ the covariance of $n_- \equiv n_\parallel - n_\perp$.

Minimal model equivalent to **pair-differencing** (PD).

## Questions

- How do DW and PD compare out of the box?
- How far is PD from the ideal reconstruction?
- What is the impact of systematic effects?

## Numerical simulations {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
To answer these questions, I performed advanced time-domain simulations of an SO-like small aperture telescope.

I used the `toast` simulation framework and adjusted it for the needs of the study.

In particular I implemented the interface between `toast` and our reconstruction library, `mappraiser` (see figure).

Massively parallel implementation of the unbiased map-making estimator presented earlier, which I developed further.

\sigma(r=0)^{-2} \approx \frac{f_\text{sky}}{2} \times \sum_{\text{bins $b$}} \Delta_\ell (2\ell_b+1) \Bigg( \frac{C_{\ell_b}^{BB,\text{prim}} \rvert_{r=1}}{C_{\ell_b}^{BB,\text{lens}} + \langle N_{\ell_b}^{BB} \rangle} \Bigg)^2
$$

Moderate increase of error bars for typical 10% variation of parameters.

## Mind The Gap! -- thesis Chapter 6 {.smaller}

:::: {.columns6040}
::: {.column}
- Motivation
  - gaps break assumptions about the noise
  - compromise efficiency and precision of map-making methods
- Contributions
  - implement gap-filling algorithm with constrained realisations in `mappraiser`
  - demonstrate "nested PCG" method: mathematically correct treatment of gaps
- Results
  - gap-filling methods lose sensitivity
  - HWP helps tremendously for polarisation
  - nested PCG enables optimal recovery with increased computational cost

Development of [`furax`](https://furax.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with SciPol team

- using [`jax`](https://docs.jax.dev) for **performance** and portability (CPU/GPU)
- able to represent **complex instrument models**
- map-making, component separation, atmosphere decontamination, etc. in a **single framework**

Applications to SO data (BB analysis group)!

- map-making with template filtering
- non-ideal optical components (HWP)

## Conclusion {.smaller}

- Primordial $B$ modes = window on first instants of the Universe
- Possible imprint in the large-scale CMB polarisation -> SATs
- Map-making = crucial step to maximise scientific return
- Ground telescopes must mitigate atmospheric contamination using dual-polarisation detectors and HWP
- No atmospheric model leads to intuitive pair differencing
- Near-optimal sensitivity to $r$ even with uneven detector properties

. . .

- Future: going to University of Manchester to work on SO SAT data
- Build a robust analysis pipeline and measure (constrain) $r$
