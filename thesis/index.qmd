## Outline

TBW

# The expanding Universe

## Introduction

- The Universe is expanding
- Universe was smaller in the past
- Hot Big Bang theory: hotter, denser, "smaller"
- How do we know that?

## Galaxies

- Milky Way x 100,000 light years
- Many other galaxies! ~10^11 in observable Universe
- Distant galaxies are moving away
- How do we know?

## Redshift I

- Like Doppler effect of sound
- The farther away, the faster a galaxy recedes from us
- Expected if all galaxies move away from each other
- i.e. If Universe expands in all directions

## Redshift II

- Spring analogy!
- Distance & redshift -> use z to talk about cosmic distances
- Light has a finite speed -> use z to talk about time
- High z is far away in space and in time

# Looking at the Big Bang: the CMB

::: {.notes}
- In cosmology, we can see the history of the Universe
  - Moon ~1.3s away/ago
  - Nearby stars ~ 10-100 years
  - Other galaxies -> millions/billions of years
- Can we look so far into the past that we see the Big Bang?
:::

## Primordial Plasma

- Hot Big Bang: all matter and radiation compressed to an unimaginable degree → denser & hotter
- In this state, ordinary matter (atoms) cannot exist
- It is a hot plasma

## Cosmic History

- "Inside-out star"
- BBN: nuclear reactions everywhere, nuclei forming
- Photons bouncing off protons & electrons, cannot travel very far
- Time passes: moving from core of the star to its diffuse edge
- Eventually (380,000 years), the first atoms form
- Photons can travel freely, like the light of the star shining out into space

## The CMB

- From our perspective, CMB photons seem to come from a spherical surface: the LSS
- This is the farthest away that we can see into the cosmos
- Visible spectrum (3000K) at the time
- Today microwave (2.7K) because of the expansion
- Blackbody spectrum: confirms Big Bang theory!

## Observing the CMB

# Cosmic inflation

::: {.notes}
- CMB: triumph of Hot Big Bang theory?
- Also a sign that cosmic history must be more complex → inflation
:::

## The Horizon Problem

- Horizon problem: why is the CMB so homogeneous?
- Points at same temperature must have been in contact
- Light from 2 opposite points "meets" for the first time right now when reaching us

## Inflation

- Most widely accepted solution: inflation
- Expansion fast enough to take a causally connected region of space and blow it up to a size bigger than our observable Universe
- Like enlarging a single pixel of an image

## Successes of Inflation

- Seeds of cosmic structure
- Still not proven
- Smoking gun: B modes
