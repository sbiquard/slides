# Introduction {background-color=#40666e}

# An expanding universe

## Expansion

- The Universe is **expanding**
  - Universe was smaller in the past
  - Hot Big Bang theory: hotter, denser, "smaller"

<!--How do we know that?-->
. . .

- Where are we?
  - Milky Way ~100,000 light years
  - Many other galaxies! ~10^11 in observable Universe
  - Distant galaxies are **moving away**

<!--How do we know that?-->
. . .

- **Redshift**
<!--Like Doppler effect of sound-->
  - Fractional change in wavelength
  - $z \equiv \frac{\lambda_0 - \lambda_1}{\lambda_1}$

## Hubble's law

::: {.notes}
- The farther away, the faster a galaxy recedes from us
- Expected if all galaxies move away from each other
- i.e. If Universe expands in all directions
-

## Redshift, distance, time

::: {.notes}
- In cosmology, we can see the history of the Universe
  - Moon ~1.3s away/ago
  - Nearby stars ~ 10-100 years
  - Other galaxies -> millions/billions of years
- Can we look so far into the past that we see the Big Bang?
:::

- Distance-redshift relation
  - use $z$ to talk about cosmic distances
- Finite speed of light
  - use $z$ to talk about time

. . .

High redshift = far away in **space** and in **time**.

We can **see** the history of the Universe!

# Looking at the Big Bang

## {background-image="assets/Universe_History_2.png"}

::: {.notes}
- Hot Big Bang: all matter and radiation compressed to an unimaginable degree → denser & hotter
- In this state, ordinary matter (atoms) cannot exist
- It is a hot plasma
- "Inside-out star"
- BBN: nuclear reactions everywhere, nuclei forming
- Photons bouncing off protons & electrons, cannot travel very far
- Time passes: moving from core of the star to its diffuse edge
- Eventually (380,000 years), the first atoms form
- Photons can travel freely, like the light of the star shining out into space

## A witness of the homogeneous early universe

::: {.notes}
- Visible spectrum (3000K) at the time
- Today microwave (2.7K) because of the expansion
- Blackbody spectrum: confirms Big Bang theory!

. . .

Same temperature in all directions. *How?*

# Cosmic inflation

::: {.notes}
- CMB: triumph of Hot Big Bang theory?
- Also a sign that cosmic history must be more complex → inflation
:::

## The Horizon Problem

- Why is the CMB so homogeneous?
- Points at same temperature must have been in contact

<!--Light from 2 opposite points "meets" for the first time right now when reaching us-->

![The horizon problem. Credits: D. Baumann](assets/horizon_problem.png)

## A solution: cosmic inflation

::: {.notes}
- Most commonly accepted solution to horizon problem
- Like enlarging a single pixel of an image
:::

Expansion fast enough to take a causally connected region of space and blow it up to a size bigger than our observable Universe.

![Coordinate grid during and after inflation (Dodelson and Schmidt, 2020)](assets/inflation.svg)

## Beyond the horizon problem

::: {.notes}
- How to achieve inflation?
  - scalar field rolling down a potential slowly
  - observations so far in agreement with single-field slow-roll models
- Most plausible mechanism for generating the seeds of cosmic structure
  - fluctuations -> different regions inflate by different amounts
  - inhomogeneities when standard Big Bang starts (reheating)
- No direct evidence of inflation yet
:::

Slow-roll inflation: $\phi$ rolling down a potential $V(\phi)$ slowly

![Scalar field rolling down its potential in slow-roll inflation ([source](https://cmb.wintherscoming.no/theory_initial.php)).](assets/scalarfield.png)

. . .

Quantum fluctuations $\delta\phi$ -> seeds of cosmic structure!

## Primordial gravitational waves

::: {.notes}
- GWs are a very clean prediction of inflation models
- measuring r gives the energy scale of inflation
- window into physics at ultra-high energies
:::

Inflation also predicts **gravitational waves**.

- Scalar perturbations: $\Delta^2_s(k) = A_s (k/k_*)^{n_s - 1}$
- Tensor perturbations: $\Delta^2_t(k) = A_t (k/k_*)^{n_t}$
- Tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \equiv A_t / A_s \propto E^4_\mathrm{inf}$.

GWs leave a unique imprint in the CMB polarization: "**B modes**".

# Observing the CMB

::: {.notes}
- What does the CMB look like?
- From our perspective, CMB photons seem to come from a spherical surface: the LSS
- This is the farthest away that we can see into the cosmos
:::

## Discovery

## Temperature anisotropies

::: {.notes}
- CMB is very uniform, but not perfectly
- Perturbations in primordial plasma -> anisotropies in CMB
:::

::: {.columns6040}
::: {.column}
The CMB is not perfectly uniform!

- Monopole (average temperature)
  - $T \sim 2.7\,\mathrm{K}$
- Dipole (motion of the Earth)
  - $\Delta T / T \sim 1 / 1000$
- Anisotropies (inhomogeneities of primordial plasma)
  - Result of **acoustic oscillations**
  - $\Delta T / T \sim 10^{-5}$

## Increasingly precise measurements

![CMB anisotropies in a 10 square degrees sky patch, seen by three generations of satellites: COBE-DMR (1989-1993), WMAP (2001-2010) and Planck (2009-2013). Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ESA.](assets/PIA16874-CobeWmapPlanckComparison_3600.png)

## Angular power spectrum {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
- CMB anisotropies are noise (acoustic oscillations)
- Spectral properties -> white, red, blue? any features?
- Temporal frequency for sound -> angular (spatial frequency) for CMB maps
- Formally: spherical harmonic decomposition of the fluctuations
:::

- How to characterise "noise"? Look at its **spectral properties**.
- Spatial/angular frequency: "multipole moment" $\ell$ -- angular separation $\theta \sim 2\pi / \ell$
- **Power spectrum** $C_\ell$ = variance of fluctuations at scale $\ell$

## CMB polarisation

- Linear polarisation from Thomson scattering $\propto \lvert \hat\epsilon \cdot \hat\epsilon' \rvert^2$
- 3 **Stokes parameters** entirely describe linear polarisation
  - $I$ = total intensity (temperature)
  - $Q$ = difference in brightness between horizontal and vertical
  - $U$ = difference in brightness between polarisations at +45° and -45°

::::

- $B$ modes are only sourced by tensor perturbations!
- By measuring CMB polarizatoin, we have access to $r$ and inflation

## Galactic foregrounds

- Galactic dust and synchrotron radiation
- Brighter than CMB polarization signal
- Frequency dependence different from CMB
- Need multi-frequency observations to separate components
- Statistical and physical modeling challenges

## Lensing

- Gravitational lensing distorts CMB anisotropies
- Creates B-modes from E-modes
- Lensing B-modes mask primordial signal
- Need to "delense" maps
- Requires precise small-scale measurements

## Systematics

- Instrumental effects can create false signals
- Temperature to polarization leakage
- Beam systematics
- Calibration uncertainties
- Ground pickup
- Need careful characterization and control

## Atmosphere

- Water vapor emission/absorption
- 1/f noise from atmospheric fluctuations
- Scanning strategy limitations
- Site selection critical
- Atmospheric monitoring and modeling

## Numerical challenges

- Large data volumes
- Complex time-ordered data processing
- Component separation algorithms
- Computationally intensive simulations
- High performance computing requirements
