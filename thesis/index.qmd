## Outline

1. Introduction to cosmology and the CMB (?? min)
2. Polarization maps from the ground (?? min)
3. TBD

# I. Introduction

# The expanding Universe

## Introduction

- The Universe is expanding
- Universe was smaller in the past
- Hot Big Bang theory: hotter, denser, "smaller"
- How do we know that?

## Galaxies

- Milky Way x 100,000 light years
- Many other galaxies! ~10^11 in observable Universe
- Distant galaxies are moving away
- How do we know?

## Redshift I

- Like Doppler effect of sound
- The farther away, the faster a galaxy recedes from us
- Expected if all galaxies move away from each other
- i.e. If Universe expands in all directions

## Redshift II

- Spring analogy!
- Distance & redshift -> use z to talk about cosmic distances
- Light has a finite speed -> use z to talk about time
- High z is far away in space and in time

# Looking at the Big Bang: the CMB

::: {.notes}
- In cosmology, we can see the history of the Universe
  - Moon ~1.3s away/ago
  - Nearby stars ~ 10-100 years
  - Other galaxies -> millions/billions of years
- Can we look so far into the past that we see the Big Bang?
:::

## Primordial Plasma

- Hot Big Bang: all matter and radiation compressed to an unimaginable degree → denser & hotter
- In this state, ordinary matter (atoms) cannot exist
- It is a hot plasma

## Cosmic History

- "Inside-out star"
- BBN: nuclear reactions everywhere, nuclei forming
- Photons bouncing off protons & electrons, cannot travel very far
- Time passes: moving from core of the star to its diffuse edge
- Eventually (380,000 years), the first atoms form
- Photons can travel freely, like the light of the star shining out into space

## The CMB

- From our perspective, CMB photons seem to come from a spherical surface: the LSS
- This is the farthest away that we can see into the cosmos
- Visible spectrum (3000K) at the time
- Today microwave (2.7K) because of the expansion
- Blackbody spectrum: confirms Big Bang theory!

## Physics of the CMB

- CMB is very uniform, but not perfectly
- Perturbations in primordial plasma -> anisotropies in CMB
- Polarization generated by Thomson scattering
- E and B modes (use Planck 2018 figure)

# Cosmic inflation

::: {.notes}
- CMB: triumph of Hot Big Bang theory?
- Also a sign that cosmic history must be more complex → inflation
:::

## The Horizon Problem

- Horizon problem: why is the CMB so homogeneous?
- Points at same temperature must have been in contact
- Light from 2 opposite points "meets" for the first time right now when reaching us

## Inflation

- Most widely accepted solution: inflation
- Expansion fast enough to take a causally connected region of space and blow it up to a size bigger than our observable Universe
- Like enlarging a single pixel of an image

## Status of inflation

- Most plausible mechanism for generating the seeds of cosmic structure
- Observations so far in agreement with single-field slow-roll models
- No direct evidence yet
- GWs are a very clean prediction of inflationary models
  - amplitude: tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \equiv A_t / A_s$
  - only source of primordial B modes
  - "smoking gun" for inflation

# Observing the CMB

::: {.notes}
What does the CMB look like?
:::

## Discovery

- 1965: Penzias & Wilson discover the CMB
- 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics

## Increasingly precise measurements

- COBE, WMAP, Planck, ACT

## Angular power spectrum

TBW

## Current constraints on $r$

- plot from Tristram 2022

# The Simons Observatory

## A Stage-3 CMB experiment

- Cerro Toco, Chile, 5200m altitude ("high and dry")
- 3 small aperture telescopes (SATs)
- 1 large aperture telescope (LAT)
- 60,000+ detectors
- 6 frequency bands, 27-280 GHz
- SATs for polarization at large scales
- LAT for small scales over large sky fraction
