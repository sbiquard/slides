## Expansion

::: {.notes}
Measure recession velocity through *redshifting*

1920s: astronomers measure redshifts of distant galaxies

The farther away the galaxy, the faster it moves away

Distance vs redshift = Hubble diagram

(figure) measure expansion rate

repulsion field? No: expected *all* galaxies moving away from each other = U expanding in every direction

<!--Here is how that kind of uniform expansion works.
Say you have a spring and stretch it out.
The two closest spirals went from being 1 mm apart to 1 cm apart, but the ends have gone from 1 cm to 50 in the same amount of time!
They started further apart, so they moved apart faster.-->

Use redshift to talk about distances

Finite speed of light: use redshift to talk about **time**

Cosmology = opportunity to see the history of our Universe directly

Can we look so far away and into the past that we see the Big Bang itself? The answer is yes.

- **Redshift** = wavelength of light stretched as galaxy moves away
- Distance-redshift relation: farther away = faster away
- The Universe is **expanding** in every direction!
- Finite speed of light: look back in time

High redshift = far away in **space** and in **time**.

## {background-image="assets/Universe_History_2.png"}

::: {.notes}
Hot Big Bang = Universe smaller in the past

Reverse expansion -> U so dense that ordinary matter could not exist -- hot plasma of elementary particles

Expansion starts. Formally: standard cosmological model (based on GR)

Nuclear reactions, first atomic nuclei (nucleosynthesis)

Photons bouncing off protons/electrons, cannot travel very far

Universe keeps expanding.

380,000 y: plasma cool enough for atoms to form (recombination)

Universe becomes transparent. Photons able to travel freely, carrying snapshot of primordial Universe

Afterglow of Big Bang called the cosmic microwave background (CMB)

CMB photons come from spherical region = surface of last-scattering

After recombination, Universe remained dark (no stars yet)

But matter not distributed uniformly -- denser regions attract matter, get hotter: nuclear fusion, first stars

Standar model: not only ordinary matter, also Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Dark Matter essential for structure formation (galaxies & clusters)

Recently, accelerated expansion started -- driven by Dark Energy

Still accelerating today!

## A witness of the homogeneous early universe

::: {.notes}
Come back to CMB

Other clue why it really is from the primordial plasma: **spectrum** (intensity of light at different wavelengths)

1990s: COBE satellite measured the CMB spectrum -> perfect blackbody (smth glowing with heat)

strong confirmation of Big Bang theory!

peak of spectrum determined by temperature

emission: 3000 K -- now 2.7 K (microwave range)

uniform temperature across the sky! whole Universe in thermal equilibrium -- paradox?

## The Horizon Problem

::: {.notes}
thermal equilibrium needs causal contact -- but light from opposite points on LSS "meets" for the first time

standard history -> not enough time!

**horizon problem**
:::

- Why is the CMB so homogeneous?
- Points at same temperature must have been in causal contact

![The horizon problem. Credits: D. Baumann](assets/horizon_problem.png)

# Cosmic inflation

::: {.notes}
In some way, the presence of the CMB is both a triumph of the Hot Big Bang theory,
and a sign that cosmic history must be more complex than the picture I described before.

In the 1980s, theorists proposed an addition to the standard Big Bang model that solves the horizon problem.
It is called cosmic inflation.
:::

## A solution: cosmic inflation

::: {.notes}
Inflation = accelerated expansion before standard expansion

(figure) like enlarging single pixel to fill entire screen

expansion took a causally connected region of space and blew it up to a size bigger than our observable Universe

something the size of a fly -> size of the Galaxy in fraction of second
:::

Take a causally connected region of space and blow it up to a size bigger than our observable Universe.

![Coordinate grid during and after inflation (Dodelson and Schmidt, 2020)](assets/inflation.svg)

## Successes of inflation {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
achieve inflation? scalar field $\phi$ with potential energy $V(\phi)$ >> kinetic --> **slow-roll**

mechanism to generate initial conditions for structure formation! -- quantum fluctuations $\delta\phi$

space inflates by different amounts -> inhomogeneities at the end of inflation -> later grow under the influence of gravity into galaxies and other structures

beam of observational evidence agreeing with predictions of single-field slow-roll inflation
:::

- "Slow-roll" inflation: $\phi$ with potential energy $V(\phi) \gg$ kinetic energy.
- Quantum fluctuations $\delta\phi$ -> seeds of cosmic structure!
- Measurements agree with slow-roll predictions: type/size of perturbations, scalar tilt, etc.

![Scalar field evolution in slow-roll inflation (D. Baumann).](assets/scalarfield.png)

## Primordial gravitational waves

::: {.notes}
But "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."

Very clean prediction of inflation: primordial gravitational waves.

Same GWs that are detected by interferometer on Earth, but completely different wavelength

Follow slide text

primordial GWs leave unique imprint in the CMB!
:::

- Quantum fluctuations -> perturbations of metric tensor (space-time)
- Amplitude of perturbations as a function of size
  - scalar: $\Delta^2_s(k) = A_s (k/k_*)^{n_s - 1}$
  - tensor: $\Delta^2_t(k) = A_t (k/k_*)^{n_t}$
- Tensor perturbations = **gravitational waves** (GWs)
- Tensor-to-scalar ratio:
$$
r \equiv A_t / A_s \propto E^4_\mathrm{inflation}
$$

- Insight into the fundamental laws of Physics at very high energies

. . .

GWs leave a unique imprint in the CMB!

# The cosmic microwave background

::: {.notes}
To understand how to detect primordial GWs in the CMB, we need to understand a bit more about the CMB itself and how we observe it.
:::

## Discovery {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
The CMB was discovered by accident in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, working at Bell Labs in New Jersey.

Experimenting with a very sensitive horn antenna (figure) for trans-atlantic communication (using balloons to echo signal).

Residual excess noise in all directions of the sky, perfectly consistent with predictions of uniform background of microwaves left over from the Big Bang.

Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978.

## Temperature anisotropies {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
Experiments try to find **anisotropies** in CMB

(figure) map = projection of sky onto flat screen

Remove average brightness -> find dipole (motion of Earth)

Remove dipole -> see anisotropies!

Relate anisotropies to initial perturbations of photon-baryon fluid

Overdense regions: gravity tries to compress, pressure pushes back -> **acoustic oscillations**

At last-scattering, photons from different regions have slightly different energy -> anisotropies

George Smoot = PI of COBE/DMR (figure)
:::

::: {.columns6040}
::: {.column}
The CMB is not perfectly uniform!

- Monopole (average temperature)
  - $T \sim 2.7\,\mathrm{K}$
- Dipole (motion of the Earth)
  - $\Delta T / T \sim 1 / 1000$
- Anisotropies (**acoustic oscillations** in the plasma)
  - $\Delta T / T \sim 10^{-5}$

## Angular power spectrum {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
How to characterise anisotropy maps to extract scientific information?

Spectral decomposition of anisotropies just like for sound waves

Temporal frequency for sound -> angular (spatial frequency) for maps

Formally: spherical harmonic decomposition

Power spectrum = variance of fluctuations at each angular scale

Acoustic peaks = harmonics of the sound waves

(figure) remarkable agreement with theory!
:::

- How to characterise "noise"? Look at its **spectral properties**.
- Spatial/angular frequency: multipole moment $\ell$ -- angular scale $\theta \sim 2\pi / \ell$
- **Power spectrum** $C_\ell$ = variance of fluctuations at scale $\ell$

# CMB polarisation

::: {.notes}
Temperature anisotropies teach us a lot about the Universe.
But to understand inflation, we need to look at another property of the CMB: its polarisation.
:::

## Basics of polarisation {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
(figure) Light is polarised when its electric field oscillates preferentially in a given direction

The CMB is polarised through Thomson scattering of photons off free electrons in the primordial plasma

Efficiency of Thomson depends on angle between incoming and outgoing polarisation directions

To characterise linearly polarised light, use Stokes parameters $I$ $Q$ and $U$

The same way as total intensity maps, we can make Q and U maps of the sky
:::

:::: {.columns7030}
::: {.column}
- Thomson scattering $\propto \lvert \hat\epsilon \cdot \hat\epsilon' \rvert^2$
- 3 **Stokes parameters** entirely characterise linearly polarised light
  - $I$ = total intensity
  - $Q$ = difference in brightness between horizontal and vertical
  - $U$ = difference in brightness between +45° and -45°

Q and U depend on coordinate system

Decomposition into $E$ (parity-even) and $B$ (parity-odd) patterns

Remarkably, $B$ modes are only sourced by **tensor** perturbations, GWs! (at first order)

By measuring CMB polarisation, specifically B modes, access to $r$ and inflation

## Current constraints on $r$

::: {.notes}
For now, no detection of primordial $B$ modes has been made.
We only have upper limits on the value of $r$.

The best constraint to date is from the BICEP/Keck collaboration combined with *Planck* data.

The figure on the right shows measurements of $B$-mode power spectrum from various experiments.

Target either recombination bump ($\ell \approx 100$) or reionisation bump ($\ell \lt 10$).

In both cases we need a measurement of the CMB polarisation at intermediate to large scales.

## The Simons Observatory {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
Measuring $r$ is one of the main science goals of the Simons Observatory.

International collaboration with 50+ institutes, 300+ members

The observatory is located in the Atacama desert in Chile, which is high and dry, ideal for millimetre-wave observations.
SO builds on decades of experience in observing CMB from the ground.

It comprises three small aperture telescopes (SATs) dedicated to the measurement of large scale polarisation.
A large aperture telescope (LAT) will observe smaller scales (high resolution) over a large fraction of the sky.

Very broad science case, from inflation to neutrino mass and number of relativistic species, etc.
But the main goal for the SATs is to reach $\sigma(r) = 0.002$.

To meet these ambitious goals, SO has deployed about 60,000 detectors over 6 frequency bands.
Observations have started since last year, and we are analysing the data now!
:::

- Cerro Toco, Chile, 5200m altitude ("high and dry")
- 3 small (SATs) + 1 large aperture telescopes (LAT)

  - baseline $\sigma(r) = 0.003$ (goal $0.002$)
- 60,000+ detectors
- 6 frequency bands, 27-280 GHz

# Reconstruction of CMB maps {background-color="#40666e"}

::: {.notes}
Now introduce specific topic of my thesis

Size and complexity of data increases with each generation of experiments -- so does the difficulty of the analysis
:::

## From time-ordered data to maps

::: {.notes}
Start from figure on the right!

Lensing converts $E$ -> $B$ *and vice versa*.

CMB signal is faint: each individual data sample is noise dominated.

To achieve a good sensitivity across a significant sky area, CMB telescopes collect lost of measurements across the targeted area by **scanning**.
This also helps to mitigate low-frequency instrumental noise.

The raw data is therefore made of *time series* (one/detector) called time-ordered data (TOD).

With knowledge of the scanning strategy (pointing information) we can reconstruct the observed sky maps -> **map-making**.

Map-making = key starting point of analysis pipeline

Must preserve all information + mitigate as many systematics as possible
:::

:::: {.columns3070}
::: {.column}
**map-making** = from time-ordered data (TOD) to sky maps at observed frequencies

data reduction step: ~6 orders of magnitude
:::

::: {.column}
![Traditional CMB analysis pipeline steps (credit: Josquin Errard)](assets/cmb_pipeline_mapmaking_box.jpeg)
:::
::::

## Linear data model

::: {.notes}
Formally: linear data model

Inverse problem -- what we recover/know/assume

Linear estimator = mapping of data to maps
:::

$$
d = Ps + Tx + n
$$

- we *know* $d$ (the data)
- we *estimate* $s$ (sky maps) and *marginalize* over $x$ (spurious signals)
- we *model* $P$ (pointing) and $T$ (templates)
- we *assume* that $n$ (noise) has covariance $N$

"Map-making" = linear operation $\hat s = L d$ to estimate sky maps from the data.

## Unbiased estimators

::: {.notes}
Weighted co-addition of the data with spurious signals filtered out.
:::

Generic linear unbiased estimator [[Poletti et al. 2017]](http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201629467)
$$
\hat s = (P^\top F_T P)^{-1} P^\top F_T d
$$

with filtering and weighting operator
$$
F_T = W \left[\mathbb I - T (T^\top W T)^{-1} T^\top W \right]
$$

- filters out unwanted signals (columns of $T$)
- weights orthogonal modes by weight matrix $W$

Minimum variance (optimal) if $W = N^{-1}$ (generalized least squares, GLS).

## Practical considerations {.smaller}

- Size of the problem
  - 1,000 detectors + months of data + sampling @100 Hz -> $n_t \sim 10^{11}$ samples (TB scale)
  - resolution + sky coverage + Stokes (I)QU -> $n_p \sim 10^5 - 10^8$ sky pixels
  - correlations -> process data in one go
  - **Numerical efficiency** and parallelism are key!

. . .

- Noise correlations $N$ (size $n_t \times n_t$)
  - split data in chunks (trade-off efficiency/quality)
  - assume noise is stationary in each chunk, $N(t,t')=N(\lvert t-t' \rvert)$
  - characterise in Fourier space (power spectral density, PSD)

. . .

- **Iterative solvers**
  - $\hat s = A^{-1} b$ -> instead solve $A s = b$
  - store $A$ implicitly without constructing the whole matrix
  - preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm
  - convergence speed influenced by noise correlations

## Observing from the ground {.smaller}

Major challenge for map-making from the ground: atmospheric emission

Loading -> more photons on average

:::

## Unbiased polarisation map-making {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
Total intensity $I$ hard to recover from the ground because of atmosphere.

Focus on polarisation instead; temperature large scales already very well measured from space (*Planck*).

Compare DW and PD and see how they manage to take advantage of hardware solutions.

very demanding benchmark!
:::

Focus on **unbiased reconstruction** of polarisation ($Q$ and $U$).

Data: $d = Ps + Tx + n$

- **Minimal model**
  - $T$ very general: no specific temporal or spatial structure
  - atmosphere identical for orthogonal detectors
- **Down-weighting** (DW)
  - no template, $Tx \rightarrow n^\mathrm{atm}$
  - GLS with $W = (N_\mathrm{atm} + N_\mathrm{instr})^{-1}$
  - stationary noise, independent between detectors
- **Ideal reconstruction**
  - atmosphere-free data: $d = P s + n$ (instr. noise only)
  - GLS with $W = N_\mathrm{instr}^{-1}$
  - benchmark tool

## Pair differencing

::: {.notes}
Write down minimal model for one pair of detectors.

Use template filtering to estimate $Q$ and $U$, marginalising over $x$.

Find pair differencing!
:::

:::: {.columns7030}
:::{.column}
Minimal model: $T \rightarrow \mathbb I$
$$
d = \begin{bmatrix} d^A \\ d^B \end{bmatrix}
    = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbb I \\ \mathbb I \end{bmatrix} x
    + \begin{bmatrix} P_{QU} \\ -P_{QU} \end{bmatrix} s_{QU}
    + \begin{bmatrix} n^A \\ n^B \end{bmatrix}
$$

GLS template filtering estimator gives
$$
\hat s_{QU} = (P_{QU}^\top N_-^{-1} P_{QU})^{-1} P_{QU}^\top N_-^{-1} d_-
$$
with $d_- \equiv d^A - d^B$ and $N_-$ the covariance of $n_- \equiv n^A - n^B$.

Minimal model equivalent to **pair-differencing** (PD).

2. Compare with ideal reconstruction
3. Impact of systematic effects

## Numerical simulations {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
To answer these questions, I performed advanced time-domain simulations of an SO-like small aperture telescope.

I used the `toast` simulation framework and adjusted it for the needs of the study.

I used the NERSC and Jean-Zay supercomputers.

In particular I implemented the interface between `toast` and our reconstruction library, `mappraiser` (see figure).

Massively parallel implementation of the unbiased map-making estimator presented earlier, which I developed further.

How do these results translate in terms of $r$ sensitivity?

Remarkably little impact given the very general assumption behind PD.

- detector-dependent parameters (knee, slope, white level)
- noise power spectrum $N_\ell^{BB}$ from reconstructed maps $\hat s^\mathrm{pd}_{QU}$
- Fisher forecast:
$$
\sigma(r=0)^{-2} \approx \frac{f_\text{sky}}{2} \times \sum_{\text{bins $b$}} \Delta_\ell (2\ell_b+1) \Bigg( \frac{C_{\ell_b}^{BB,\text{prim}} \rvert_{r=1}}{C_{\ell_b}^{BB,\text{lens}} + \langle N_{\ell_b}^{BB} \rangle} \Bigg)^2

- Motivation
  - gaps break assumptions about the noise
  - compromise efficiency and precision of map-making methods
- Contributions
  - gap-filling algorithm in `mappraiser`: synthetic samples
  - demonstrate "nested PCG" method: mathematically correct treatment of gaps
- Results
  - gap-filling methods lose sensitivity
  - HWP helps tremendously for polarisation
  - nested PCG enables optimal recovery with increased computational cost

## A toolbox for the SciPol project {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
CMB polarisation analysis mixes instrument + foregrounds + cosmology.

Instrumental effects can be freqneucy-dependent -> time-domain component separation.

Development of `furax` (<https://furax.readthedocs.io/en/>) with SciPol team

- using [`jax`](https://docs.jax.dev) for **performance** and portability (CPU/GPU)
- able to represent **complex instrument models**
- map-making, component separation, atmosphere decontamination, etc. in a **single framework**

Applications to SO data (BB analysis group)!

- map-making with template filtering
- non-ideal optical components (HWP)

## Conclusions

- **Context**: enable ground experiments to reach sensitivity for $B$ modes
- **Goal**: Building a robust analysis pipeline and measure (constrain) $r$
- **Contributions**:
  - demonstrated near-optimal performance of pair differencing in realistic conditions
  - implemented robust treatment of timestream gaps
  - multiple software packages: `mappraiser`, `furax`, `jax-healpy`
- **Future**: going to University of Manchester to apply these to SO SAT data

## Calibration study using el-nods

- need for accurate relative calibration
- use atmosphere as a calibrator
- assessed impact of modelling, pointing errors
- found a typical $1\%$ gain uncertainty using el-nods
